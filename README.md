# Hebcal JavaScript

Original C written by Danny Sadinoff, with portions by Michael J. Radwin.
2014 JavaScript port by Eyal Schachter (age 15).

## Description

Hebcal JS is a JavaScript API to aid working with the Hebrew calendar. It is available for both browser and Node.JS.

It can convert between Hebrew and Gregorian dates, get weekly sedra, holidays, and halachik times (_zemanim_).

You can include it in a client-side (browser) script with the `hebcal.min.js` script in the `client` subfolder (17KB gzipped). It exposes a global variable, `Hebcal`. For Node, install `hebcal` from NPM...

```sh
$ npm install hebcal
```

...and include Hebcal with `var Hebcal = require('hebcal');`

Hebcal JS is currently at version 2.3.2. It is approximately equivalent to Hebcal C 3.15.
I (Eyal) did not write Hebcal JS 1.0. 2.x is a nearly-complete rewrite of it.

The version documented here is 2.3.2.

## Information on certain standards

### Descriptions

Sometimes a "description array" will be mentioned. This is an array with between 1 and 3 properties: `[Sfardit pronunciation[, Ashkenazis pronunciation[, Hebrew spelling]]]`.

Methods that fetch a value from this array expect one of the following strings: "a" for Ashkenazis, "h", for Hebrew, and anything else for Sfardit.

### Month names

Hebcal is not too particular about month names, and only checks up to the second letter. That means that, despite being totally incorrect, "cheese" will return the same value as "cheshvan". Month names work in both Hebrew and English.

Nisan, Iyyar, Sivan, Tamuz, Av, Elul, Tishrei, Cheshvan, Kislev, Tevet, Shvat, Adar (1, 2).
ניסן, אייר, סיון, תמוז, אב, אלול, תשרי, חשון, כסלו, טבת, שבט, אדר (1, 2).

### Sun times

Hebcal JS uses the [SunCalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) JavaScript library to calculate sun times. They do not provide an accuracy claim, but i have found their times to be up to 3 minutes off from the accepted times. Do not rely on Zemanim until the last moment!

### Finding location in browser

Both scripts run on the exact same code, except for one thing. In the browser, Hebcal will attempt to set `Hebcal.defaultLocation` to the user's location using the [geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation) API. The `ready` event (see `Hebcal.events`) is fired once the location has been obtained, or failed to be obtained.

This will cause any webpages with the Hebcal script to request the user's permission to view their location. If they deny it, the default location will be `[0, 0]`.

To turn off this feature, use the `hebcal.noloc.min.js` script instead of the usual `hebcal.min.js` script. The unminified version is `hebcal.noloc.js`. All of these files are in the `client` folder.

### Source maps

When using Hebcal JS in the browser, it may be helpful for debugging to include a sourcemap file for browsers that support it. Both minified and unminified, regular and noloc, have a sourcemap file. This is `<js filename>.map`.

### Ordering in this documentation

Be forewarned: the ordering of properties/methods in this documentation is almost completely arbitrary. It mostly follows the order of the code, which is itself written in pretty much whatever order i decided i needed those methods. If you're looking for a specific thing, i highly recommend using your browser's find tool (ctrl+f, or cmd+f for you Mac types). If you just want to know everything about Hebcal JS, just start at the top and work your way down.

## Command line interface

Hebcal JS (as of v2.1) also provides a simple CLI. It's mainly for just testing output. If you really need an advanced CLI, use the [main Hebcal code](https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal).

You can access this CLI by installing Hebcal JS globally from NPM:

```sh
npm install -g hebcal
```

This exposes the `hebcaljs` command. This is to differentiate it from the ordinary `hebcal` command.

For usage information, run `hebcaljs -h`.

## `Hebcal`

The global variable (if running in the browser) `Hebcal` is the entrypoint to Hebcal. It is a constructor returning an object represtenting a Hebrew year, and also has many other properties.

```
new Hebcal([year[, month]]);
```

`year`, if provided, should be an `int` representing a Hebrew year, for example, `5774`. If it is falsey (includes `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `false`, etc), it defaults to the current year. If it is not falsy, and not a number, Hebcal will throw an error.

`month`, if provided, supports multiple types:

* String -- The name of a single month.
* Number -- The number of a single month (Nisan is 1, Tishrei 7).
* Array -- An array of either of the above two, or mixed. Basically, anything that can be passed to `Hebcal.Month` (see below).

If not provided, it defaults to all of the months in the given `year`.
If it is a different type, Hebcal will throw an error.

To get the full current year:

```js
var year = new Hebcal();
```

### Properties on `Hebcal` instances

#### `Hebcal.prototype.year`

Number. The year represented in the `Hebcal`. (Not actually a prototype value.)

#### `Hebcal.prototype.months`

Array of `Hebcal.Month`s. Is not intended to be used directly, but rather with the `getMonth()` and `map()` methods. (Not actually a prototype value.)

#### `Hebcal.prototype.holidays`

v2.2 and later: An object, with keys as `HDate` strings, and values are arrays of `Hebcal.holidays.Event`s. It is not recommended to use this object directly. Instead, use `HDate().holidays()` for fetching and `Hebcal().addHoliday()` for adding.

BEFORE v2.2: Array of holidays, as `Hebcal.holidays.Event`s, for the represented year.

Not actually a prototype value.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.length`

Number of days in the year. (Not actually a prototype value.)

#### `Hebcal.prototype.il`

Boolean get/set. Whether the current location is in Israel or not. This is relevant with regards to holidays.
This gets set by `Hebcal.defaultCity`, and `year.setCity()`. It's possible that you may have to set it yourself in certain circumstances. (Not actually a prototype value.)

#### `Hebcal.prototype.lat` and `long`

Number get/sets. The latitude and longitude of the current location. This is relevant with regards to getting times for dates. (Not actually prototype values.)
Default: 0.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.setCity(city)`

```js
year.setCity('Jerusalem');
```

Sets the lat/long to the given city's location. Returns the `Hebcal` it was called upon. This allows for easy method chaining.

For more information regarding cities, see `Hebcal.cities` below.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.setLocation(latitude, longitude)`

```js
year.setLocation(40.716, -74.016); // coords of New York
```

Sets the lat/long to the given location. Returns the `Hebcal` it was called upon.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.isLeapYear()`

```js
var isleap = year.isLeapYear();
```

Takes 0 arguments, returns a boolean.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.next()`

```js
var nextYear = year.next();
```

Takes 0 arguments, returns `Hebcal` representing the following year.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.prev()`

```js
var prevYear = year.prev();
```

Takes 0 arguments, returns `Hebcal` representing the preceding year.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.getMonth(month)`

```js
var tishrei = year.getMonth(7);
var adar2 = year.getMonth(-1);
var shvat = year.getMonth('shvat');
var elul = year.getMonth('אלול');
var nextNisan = year.getMonth(13); // in a non-leap year
```

Takes a single argument, the month to get. Returns `Hebcal.Month` representing the requested month.

If the month is a positive number, it is a month index. Remember, Nisan is 1, Tishrei 7.
If the month is a negative number, it is a month index from the end of the year.
If the month is a string, it can be a month name in Hebrew or English.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.getDay(day)`

Takes a single argument, the day to get. `day` should be a number representing the number of days from Nisan 1. Nisan 1 is 1, Rosh Hashanah is usually a little above 200, but it can vary. Returns a `Hebcal.HDate` representing the requested day.

If the day is a positive number, it is a day index.
If the day is a negative number, it is a day index from the end of the year. So, 1 would be the 29th of Elul.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.days()`

Return an array of all the days in the year. This method was added in Hebcal JS 2.1.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.map(mapFunc[, thisArg])`

In 2.0: A shortcut for `year.months.map(mapFunc, [thisArg])`.

In 2.1 and beyond: Map over each day in the year, calling `mapFunc` in context of `thisArg`. Returns an array.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.filter(filterFunc[, thisArg])`

Only keep days in the year that pass the `filterFunc` tester function. Returns an array of `Hebcal.HDate`s. This method was added in Hebcal JS 2.1.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.addHoliday(event)`

Add a holiday to the list of holidays. Throws an error if `event` is not a `Hebcal.holidays.Event`. Returns the `Hebcal` it was called upon.

```js
year.addHoliday(new Hebcal.holidays.Event(new Date(2014,0,1), 'New Years Day', Hebcal.holidays.masks.USER_EVENT));
```

See `Hebcal.holidays` for more information on creating an event.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.findSedra(parsha, o)`

Find the Shabbat on which a given parsha is read. The parsha name (first argument) should correspond to the language string ('s', 'a', or 'h') in the second argument. If no second argument is provided, the parsha should be in Sfardit.

As of v2.2.1, the language string is ignored and checks all languages by default.

This method was added in v2.1.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.findParsha(parsha, o)`

An alias of `findSedra()`. This method was added in v2.1.

#### `Hebcal.prototype.find()`

A "magical" method that allows finding dates in the year. It supports several types of arguments, and is extensible. Returns an array of `Hebcal.HDate`s.

If called with a single argument:

* `Hebcal.HDate`: Find that Hebrew date in the year. This is useful, because getting a date specifically from the year, and not recreating it, gives it a few additional properties, such as a pre-set location, and a reference to the containing year.
* `Date`: Find that Gregorian date in the year.
* `Array`: An array of acceptible arguments to `year.find()`. If an item is an array, it is treated as passing multiple arguments to `find()`.
* `String`: A description of a date. See `find.strings` below.

If called with two arguments: the first represents a day, or list of days, in a month; and the second represents a month, or list of months.
The day is anything that can be passed to `Hebcal.Month.prototype.find()` (see below).
If the month is a:

* `Hebcal.Month`: Search for the day in that month. This is usually used only internally; it's more user-friendly to use one of the other types.
* `Number`: A number to be given to `Hebcal.prototype.getMonth()`.
* `String`: A month name.
* `Array`: An array of any of the above, mixed as you please.

##### `Hebcal.prototype.find.strings`

This is technically a function for internal use, but it also serves as the extension point for passing strings. Simply set a property on it, and that can be used as a string to `Hebcal.prototype.find()`.
To let the passed string be more user-friendly, the following conversions are done: convert to lowercase; replace spaces with underscores. This means that "rosh chodesh", "Rosh Chodesh", and "ROSH_CHODESH" all evaluate to "rosh_chodesh".

The following properties are defined by default:

* `rosh_chodesh` (all roshei chodashim in the year)
* `holidays` (days with a holiday defined in `year.holidays`)
* `omer` (days in sefirat ha'omer)
* `pesach`
* `sukkot` (aliased as `sukkos`, `succot`, `succos`)
* `shavuot` (aliased as `shavuos`)
* `rosh_hashana` (aliased as `rosh_hashanah`)
* `today`
* `yesterday`
* `tomorrow`

To extend the list, add a property of `Hebcal.prototype.find.strings`. The name should be all lowercase, and spaces replaced with underscores, as described above. The property itself should be a function taking a no arguments. Within the function, `this` refers to the object that `find()` is being called on. It should return an Array. It is perfectly acceptible to return the result of another `find()` call.

## `Hebcal.addZeman(zeman, func)`

An alias of `Hebcal.HDate.addZeman`. See there.

## `Hebcal.cities`

Get locations for several cities around the world.

### `Hebcal.cities.getCity(cityName)`

Returns an array describing the location of a city, or an array of `0`s if the city wasn't found. This array is intended to be passed to `Hebcal.cities.getLocation()`.

In v2.0: `[/* number */ latdeg, /* number */ latmins, /* number */ longdeg, /* number */ longmins, /* boolean */ Israel]`

In v2.1+: `[/* number */ lat, /* number */ long, /* boolean */ Israel]`

The old syntax also works.

### `Hebcal.cities.getLocation(cityInfo)`

Is intended to receive the return value of `getCity()`. Returns an object containing 2 properties: `lat` and `long`, with the numbers in degrees, including minutes.

An end-user should rarely need either of these; they are mainly used by `Hebcal.defaultCity` and `Hebcal.setCity()` and the methods they call.

This method has been **removed** as of v2.1.1.

### `Hebcal.cities.listCities()`

Return an array containing the names of all supported cities.

### `Hebcal.cities.addCity(city, info)`

Add a city to the list of cities. The first argument should be the name, the second an array of the kind that `getCity()` returns.
This method does not return anything.

### `Hebcal.cities.nearest(lat, long)`

Return the name of the city nearest to the given coordinates.

The coordinates can be given either as numbers, or as arrays of `[deg, mins]`. The array format is deprecated as of v2.1.

## `Hebcal.defaultCity`

String get/set. The nearest city to `Hebcal.defaultLocation`.

## `Hebcal.defaultLocation`

Array of coordinates that are used as the default location when creating a new instance of `Hebcal` or `Hebcal.HDate`.

`[latdeg, longdeg]`

## `Hebcal.holidays`

A holiday/event interface.

### `Hebcal.holidays.masks`

An object containing bitmasks for use when creating a `Hebcal.holidays.Event`.

```js
masks.USER_EVENT          = 1;
masks.LIGHT_CANDLES       = 2;
masks.YOM_TOV_ENDS        = 4;
masks.CHUL_ONLY           = 8; // chutz l'aretz (Diaspora)
masks.IL_ONLY             = 16; // b'aretz (Israel)
masks.LIGHT_CANDLES_TZEIS = 32;
```

### `Hebcal.holidays.IGNORE_YEAR`

A constant to be passed to both `Date` and `Hebcal.HDate` constructors. It means run this holiday every year, not just one specific year. It is automatically applied to Gregorian dates.

This is **removed** as of Hebcal JS 2.2.0.

### `new Hebcal.holidays.Event(date, desc[, masks])`

A constructor for Events. This is meant to be added to a holidays list.

`date` can be either a Gregorian `Date` object or a `Hebcal.HDate` object.

`desc` can be a description array, or string. A description array looks like: `[Sfardit pronounciation[, Ashkenazis pronounciation[, Hebrew spelling]]]`. If the Sfardit and Ashkenazis are the same, pass `null` for Ashkenazis.

`masks` should be a bitmask of the items in `Hebcal.holidays.masks`. I.e. `Hebcal.holidays.masks.IL_ONLY | Hebcal.holidays.masks.YOM_TOV_ENDS`.

#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.date`

A `Hebcal.HDate` representing the date passed to the constructor. (Not actually a prototype value.)

#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.desc`

An Array, either the array passed as `desc`, or the string passed, wrapped in an array. (Not actually a prototype value.)

#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.IGNORE_YEAR`

**This property is removed as of Hebcal JS 2.2.0.**

Boolean, whether or not we ignore the year of the date. Always true for Gregorian dates. (Not actually a prototype value.)

#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.USER_EVENT`
#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.LIGHT_CANDLES`
#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.YOM_TOV_ENDS`
#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.CHUL_ONLY`
#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.IL_ONLY`
#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.LIGHT_CANDLES_TZEIS`

Booleans, whether or not the bitmasks for those values were provided. (Not actually prototype values.)

#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.is([date[, il]])`

Returns a Boolean, whether or not the event applies for a given date.

`date`, if provided, can be a `Hebcal.HDate` or a Gregorian `Date`. If undefined, defaults to the current date.

`il`, if provided, should be a Boolean whether or not you are in Israel. If undefined, defaults to the value of `Hebcal.holidays.Event.isIL`. As of v2.2.0, `il` defaults to the `il` property of `date`.

#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.masks()`

Returns a number representing the original bitmask passed to the constructor.

#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.getDesc(o)`

Returns a string of the description. `o` can be one of the standard language strings.

#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.candleLighting()`

Return a `Date` object representing the candle-lighting time for an event, if applicable. Otherwise, returns null.

The number of minutes before sunset can be customized with the `Hebcal.holidays.Event.candleLighting` property.

#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.havdalah()`

Return a `Date` object representing the havdalah time for an event, if applicable. Otherwise, returns null.

The number of minutes after sunset can be customized with the `Hebcal.holidays.Event.havdalah` property.

#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.routine()`

This property was added in v2.2.0.

Returns a Boolean, whether or not this is a "routine" event. Routine events are not included by default in `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.holidays()`.

The default routine events are `Shabbat` and `Erev Shabbat`. This can be customized by changing the `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.routine.names` array.

#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.isIL`

Boolean, are we in Israel? Is not automatically set. Default `false`.

#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.candleLighting`

The number of minutes before sunset to light candles. Defaults to 18.

#### `Hebcal.holidays.Event.havdalah`

The number of minutes after sunset to make havdalah. Defaults to 42. In v2.0, it defaulted to 50.

### `Hebcal.holidays.standards`

Array of standard holidays that do not change based on years. Is used internally, and exported only incidentally.

This has been **removed** as of Hebcal JS 2.1.

### `Hebcal.holidays.getHolidaysForYear(year)`

Returns an array of all holidays for the year, including variable ones. Is used internally, and exported only incidentally.

This has been **removed** as of Hebcal JS 2.1.

## `Hebcal.candleLighting`

An alias of `Hebcal.holidays.Event.candleLighting`.

## `Hebcal.havdalah`

An alias of `Hebcal.holidays.Event.havdalah`.

## `Hebcal.parshiot`

An array of parsha names. Each item in the array is a description array (see intro). The second item is often null, so it is worthwhile to use `Hebcal.LANGUAGE()` to extract the names. This property was added in v2.1.

## `Hebcal.LANGUAGE(str, o)`

Return a language from a string. `o` should be a standard options string. This is mostly internal, but can be useful with regards to `Hebcal.parshiot` (above), for listing parsha names in a certain language. This property was added in v2.1.

## `Hebcal.gematriya(string | num[, limit])`

Return a gematriya string from a number, or a number from a string. Is imperfect above 1000.

The `limit` parameter can be a number, which is how many digits to truncate the original number to. Digits are removed from the beginning.

```js
Hebcal.gematriya(5774, 3) === 'תשע"ד' // first converted to 774
Hebcal.gematriya(5774) === 'התשע"ד'
Hebcal.gematriya(5) === "ה'"
Hebcal.gematriya('התשע"ד') === 5774 // the ה before a high number means 5000
Hebcal.gematriya('ה"ד') === 9 // just adds them up
Hebcal.gematriya(1234) === 'תתררל"ד'
```

## `Hebcal.range(start, end[, step])`

Return an array containing numbers between `start` and `end`, at an interval of `step`. Can be useful with `find()`, for fetching a bunch of days.

`step` defaults to 1 if not provided.

```js
Hebcal.range(1, 10) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Hebcal.range(1, 10, 2) // [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Hebcal.range(15, 1, 3) // [15, 12, 9, 6, 3]
Hebcal.range(1, 2, 0.25) // [1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2]
```

## `Hebcal.map(object, mapFunc[, thisArg])`

Similar to `Array.prototype.map`, but for objects.

Prior to v2.2, this function accepted a fourth argument, `sameprops`. It is now **obsolete**.

## `Hebcal.filter(object, filterFunc[, thisArg])`

Similar to `Array.prototype.filter`, but for objects. `filterFunc` supports multiple types:

* Boolean: keep only truthy/falsey values
* Array: keep only those keys
* Function: test the function on each item of the object, passing it arguments `val, index, object`.

## `new Hebcal.Month(month, year)`

This constructor contains information on a Hebrew month. It is not intended to be directly constructed, but it is fetched by `Hebcal.prototype.getMonth()`, so is useful to the end-user.

```js
var month = new Hebcal.Month(7, 5774); // Tishrei
var month = new Hebcal.Month('Tishrei', 5774); // Tishrei
```

`month` can be a month name or number; `year` must be a number. An error is thrown if one of these conditions is not met.

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.month`

A number representing the `month` argument to the constructor. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.year`

A number representing the `year` argument to the constructor. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.days`

An array of days in the month. Each day is an instance of `Hebcal.HDate`. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.length`

Number; the length of the month. Equivalent to the length of the `days` array. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.il`

Boolean get/set. Whether or not the location is in Israel. Is usually set by the parent year. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.lat`, `Hebcal.Month.prototype.long`

Number get/set. Latitude/Longitude of the location. Is usually set by the parent year. (Not actually prototype values.)

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.__year`

Internal, non-enumerable. A reference to the containing year. Only set if the month was created by a `Hebcal()`. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.isLeapYear()`

Returns a Boolean, whether or not the year is a leap year.

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.prev()`

Returns a `Hebcal.Month` representing the previous month.

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.next()`

Returns a `Hebcal.Month` representing the following month.

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.getDay(day)`

Returns a `Hebcal.HDate` at a 1-based index in the month. Negative indices are from the end of the month.

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.getYearObject()`

Returns `this.__year` internal value.

As of v2.1, if it is "unaffiliated" (no `__year`), return a new `Hebcal` object.

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.getName(o)`

Returns a string with the name of the month. Takes a standard options string.

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.rosh_chodesh()`

Returns an array containing `Hebcal.HDate`s for that month's Rosh Chodesh. Returns an array whether Rosh Chodesh is one or two days.

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.map(mapFunc[, thisArg])`

A shortcut for `month.days.map(mapFunc, [thisArg])`.

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.molad()`

Returns an object representing the [Molad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molad) for the month. This method is *new* in v2.2.0.

The object returned has the following properties:

* `doy` - Number, from 0-6, with the day of week
* `hour` - Number, from 1-24, with the hour of the molad
* `minutes` - Number, from 0-59, with the minute
* `chalakim` - Number, from 0-17, with the chalakim of the minute
* `day` - Date, containing the exact time of the molad

### `Hebcal.Month.prototype.find(day)`

A method similar to `Hebcal.prototype.find()` (see there), but specifically for a single month.

If `day` is a number, it is a 1-based index in the month. String, `Hebcal.HDate`, `Date`, and Array rules are the same as for `Hebcal.prototype.find()`.

Default strings are:

* `rosh_chodesh`: Same as `Hebcal.Month.prototype.rosh_chodesh()`
* `shabbat_mevarchim` (aliased as `shabbos_mevorchim`): The last Shabbat in the month.

Strings are extensible in the same manner: Add a property of `Hebcal.Month.prototype.find.strings`. Name conversion rules and function context apply the same as with `Hebcal.prototype.find()`.

`find()` returns an array of `Hebcal.HDate`s.

This method is sometimes called by `Hebcal.prototype.find()`.

## `new Hebcal.HDate([day[, month[, year]]])`

An `HDate` represents a Hebrew date.

`HDate` supports multiple types.

If 0 arguments are passed, or only one is and it is undefined, return an `HDate` object representing the current date.

```js
var day = new Hebcal.HDate();`
```

If 1 argument is passed:

* Gregorian `Date`: An `HDate` object representing that date.
  * Before v2.2: If the date is after sunset, it is the next day.
* `HDate`: Clone the object.
* String: Split the string by whitespace, and parse that.
* Number: Number of days since December 31, 1 BCE.

```js
var day = new Hebcal.HDate(new Date(2014, 0, 1));
var day = new Hebcal.HDate('1 Tishrei 5774');
var day = new Hebcal.HDate('15 Adar 2 5774');
```

If 2: An `HDate` with the given `day` and `month`, and the current year.

```js
var day = new Hebcal.HDate(15, 1); // Pesach
var day = new Hebcal.HDate("ו'", "סיון");
```

If 3: Numbers, or a month name for the second argument. Days and months are 1 based. If any values are out of range, e.g. the 31st of Nisan, convert them to proper values, i.e. 1st of Iyyar.

```js
var day = new Hebcal.HDate(7, 2, 5770);
var day = new Hebcal.HDate(40, 'elul', 5773); // 11 Tishrei 5774
```

`Hebcal.HDate` will throw an error if bad arguments are passed.

The location will be set to `Hebcal.defaultLocation`.

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.year`

Numbers. The latitude/longitude of the location. These default to the values of `Hebcal.defaultLocation`. (Not actually prototype values.)

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.il`

Boolean. Whether the current location is in Israel or not. This is relevant with regards to holidays.
This gets set by `Hebcal.defaultCity`, and `day.setCity()`. It's possible that you may have to set it yourself in certain circumstances. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.__month`

Internal, non-enumerable. A reference to the containing month. Only set if the day was created by a `Hebcal.Month()`. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.getFullYear()`

```

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.onOrBefore(dayNumber)`

Returns an `HDate` representing the a `dayNumber` on or before the current date. Sunday is 0, Saturday 6. This property was added in Hebcal JS 2.1.

```js

new Hebcal.HDate(new Date('Saturday February 22, 2014')).onOrBefore(6).greg() // Sat Feb 22 2014
new Hebcal.HDate(new Date('Sunday February 23, 2014')).onOrBefore(6).greg() // Sat Feb 22 2014
```

```

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.getMonthObject()`

Return `this.__month` internal.

As of v2.1, if it is "unaffiliated" (no `__month`), return a new `Hebcal.Month`.

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.getYearObject()`

Call `getYearObject()` of `this.getMonthObject()`.

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.getGregMonthObject()`

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.holidays(all)`

Return an array containing `Hebcal.holidays.Event`s applying to the current day.

The `all` argument was added in v2.2.0. If not included, it defaults to `false`. The action in prior versions is as if `true` was passed.

If `all` is not present, or is false, the function only returns events that apply to the current location, and omits "routine" events. For a definition of "routine", see `Hebcal.holidays.Event.prototype.rotuine()`. If `all` is present and is `true`, or using a version before 2.2.0, all events are returned, whether or not they are relevant.

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.omer()`

```js
new Hebcal.HDate(20, 'iyyar').omer() // 35

new Hebcal.HDate(15, 'nisan').omer() // 0
```

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.dafyomi(o)`

Return a string containing the day's Daf Yomi. Takes a standard language options string.

```js
new Hebcal.HDate(15, 'nisan', 5774).dafyomi() // Beitzah 16
new Hebcal.HDate(15, 'elul', 5772).dafyomi('a') // Berachos 30
```

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.tachanun()`

Return a bitmask containing information on what Tachanun (or Tzidchatcha on Shabbat) is said on that day. For an explanation of how this works, see [issue #38](https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal-js/issues/38#issuecomment-300735615).

Tachanun is not said on Rosh Chodesh, the month of Nisan, Lag Baomer, Rosh Chodesh Sivan until Isru Chag, Tisha B'av, 15 Av, Erev Rosh Hashanah, Rosh Hashanah, Erev Yom Kippur until after Simchat Torah, Chanukah, Tu B'shvat, Purim and Shushan Purim, and Purim and Shushan Purim Katan.

In some congregations Tachanun is not said until from Rosh Chodesh Sivan until 14th Sivan, Sukkot until after Rosh Chodesh Cheshvan, Pesach Sheini, Yom Ha'atzmaut, and Yom Yerushalayim.

Tachanun is not said at Mincha on days before it is not said at Shacharit. Tachanun is not said at Shacharit on Shabbat, but is at Mincha, usually.

The bitmask is made up of the following values:

* 0 - No Tachanun, according to everybody
* 1 - Tachanun is said at Mincha
* 2 - Tachanun is said at Shacharit
* 4 - All congregations say Tachanun on the day

These bitmasks are also available as properties of the function:

* `tachanun.NONE = 0`
* `tachanun.MINCHA = 1`
* `tachanun.SHACHARIT = 2`
* `tachanun.ALL_CONGS = 4`

However, due to the lengthliness of typing `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.tachanun.*BITMASK*`, it may be easier to just use the values directly.

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.tachanun_uf()`

*New as of v2.2.4*

Return a user-friendly representation of tachanun(). An object with Boolean properties {shacharit, mincha, all_congs}.

```js
new Hebcal.HDate('1 Tishrei').tachanun_uf() // { shacharit: false, mincha: false, all_congs: false }
new Hebcal.HDate('25 Tishrei').tachanun_uf() // { shacharit: true, mincha: true, all_congs: false }
new Hebcal.HDate('6 Cheshvan').tachanun_uf() // { shacharit: true, mincha: true, all_congs: true }
new Hebcal.HDate().onOrAfter(5).tachanun_uf() // Friday: { shacharit: true, mincha: false, all_congs: true }
new Hebcal.HDate().onOrAfter(6).tachanun_uf() // Shabbat: { shacharit: false, mincha: true, all_congs: true }
```

### `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.hallel()`

Return a number containing information on what Hallel is said on that day.

Whole Hallel is said on Chanukah, the first Yom Tov of Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot, Yom Ha'atzmaut, and Yom Yerushalayim.

Half Hallel is said on Rosh Chodesh (not Rosh Hashanah), and the last 6 days of Pesach.

The number is one of the following values:

* 0 - No Hallel
* 1 - Half Hallel
* 2 - Whole Hallel

These values are also available as properties of the function:

* `hallel.NONE = 0`
* `hallel.HALF = 1`
* `hallel.WHOLE = 2`

However, due to the uncomfortableness of typing `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.hallel.*BITMASK*`, it may be easier to just use the values directly.

### `Hebcal.HDate.defaultLocation`

An alias of `Hebcal.defaultLocation`.

### `Hebcal.HDate.defaultCity`

An alias of `Hebcal.defaultCity`.

### `Hebcal.HDate.hebrew2abs(hdate)`

Return an absolute date from an `HDate`. Equivalent to `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.abs()`.

**Obsolete** in 2.1. Use `HDate().abs()`.

### `Hebcal.HDate.abs2hebrew(absdate)`

Return an `HDate` from absolute date. Equivalent to `new Hebcal.HDate(absdate)`.

**Obsolete** in 2.1. Use `new HDate()`.

### `Hebcal.HDate.addZeman(zeman, func)`

Add a zeman to the object of times returned by `Hebcal.HDate.prototype.getZemanim()`. This function is aliased as `Hebcal.addZeman()`.

`zeman` should be the name of the zeman; `func` should be a function taking one parameter, the `HDate` to get the zeman for. `func` should return a `Date` object with the time.

## `Hebcal.ready` (client-side only)

Boolean; whether the geolocating code has completed or failed yet. If using the noloc script, it is always true.

## `Hebcal.onready()` (client-side only, deprecated 2.1)

Set this to a function to be executed when geolocation has finished. Is called immediately upon being set in a no-loc environment.

This function is liable to be buggy.

This has been replaced as of Hebcal 2.1 with the `ready` event (see below). It will still work, but it is preferable not to use it.

## `Hebcal.events`

A bunch of Hebcal-related events. This object is an instance of Node's [`events.EventEmitter`](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html). See there for methods.

Just a quick overview in case you don't feel like looking there right now:

```js
Hebcal.events.on('locationChange', function(oldloc){
	console.log('moved from '+oldloc+' to '+Hebcal.defaultLocation);
});
Hebcal.events.removeListener('locationChange', Hebcal.events.listeners('locationChange')[0]);
```

This property is new in Hebcal 2.1.

### `Hebcal.events.refreshInterval`

Number get/set. How often, in milliseconds, to check for zemanim and day changes.
Upon being set, it updates the time of the interval.
Defaults to 300000, which is 5 minutes.
If set to 0, disables checking.

### `Hebcal.events.beforeZeman`

Number. If it is under this number of milliseconds before a zeman, call the `almostZeman` event.
Defaults to 600000, which is 10 minutes.

### `Hebcal.events.customs`

Object of custom events, default empty. Each key in the object should be the name of a custom event, the property a `Date` object or UNIX timestamp number.

A `custom` event will be fired when the date reaches one of these times.

I figured that as long as i was building in time-based alerts, i could add this.

### Events that can be emitted

#### `ready` (client-side only)

Fires when geolocating finished. If it is only set after geolocation finishes, all `ready` events are called then.

#### `locationChange`

Fires when the location is set using `Hebcal.defaultLocation` or `Hebcal.defaultCity`. WARNING: it does not fire when using `Hebcal.HDate.defaultLocation` or `Hebcal.HDate.defaultCity`.

#### `dayChange`

Fires at sunset. Sunset is calculated according to `Hebcal.defaultLocation`.

#### `almostZeman(zeman, msUntil)`

Fires when it is almost a zeman. Almost is if the current time is less than `Hebcal.events.beforeZeman` milliseconds until a zeman. Zemanim are calculated according to `Hebcal.defaultLocation`.

The callback function for this event is passed two parameters: the name of the zeman, and the number of milliseconds until it occurs (approximately).

#### `atZeman(zeman)`

Fires when the time is at a zeman. Zemanim are calculated according to `Hebcal.defaultLocation`. This is not precise; rather, it fires if there will not be another check before the zeman passes.

The callback function for this event is passed one parameter: the name of the zeman.

#### `custom(time)`

Fires when the time is at a custom breakpoint. This is not precise; rather, it fires if there will not be another check before the time passes.

The callback function for this event is passed one parameter: the name of the custom event.

## `new Hebcal.GregYear([year[, month]])`

A constructor similar to `new Hebcal()`, but instead of being based on Hebrew years, `GregYear` is based on a Gregorian year. This property was added in Hebcal JS 2.1.

`year`, if provided, should be a number representing a Gregorian year, for example, `2014`.
If it is falsey (includes `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `false`, etc), it defaults to the current year.

If it is a string, it can either be just a number with the year, or a year number and month. Anything that `new Date()` accepts works. For example, all of the following evaluate to February 2014: `2014-2`, `2014 Feb`, `2014/02`, `February 2014`.

If it is not falsy, and not a number or string, Hebcal will throw an error.

`month`, if provided, supports multiple types:

* String -- The name of a single month.
* Number -- The number of a single month (January is 1)
* Array -- An array of either of the above two, or mixed. Basically, anything that can be passed to `Hebcal.GregMonth` (see below).

If not provided, it defaults to all of the months in the given `year`.
If it is a different type, Hebcal will throw an error.

To get the full current year:

```js
var gregyear = new Hebcal.GregYear();
```

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.year`

Number. The year passed to the constructor. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.months`

Array of `Hebcal.GregMonth`s. Is not intended to be used directly, but rather with the `getMonth()` and `map()` methods. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.hebyears`

Array of numbers, which Hebrew years are in this Gregorian year. Only includes Hebrew years for the months passed.

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.holidays`

Array of holidays, as `Hebcal.holidays.Event`s, for the represented year. Can be used directly. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.length`

Number of days in the year. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.il`

Boolean get/set. Whether the current location is in Israel or not. This is relevant with regards to holidays.
This gets set by `Hebcal.defaultCity`, and `gregyear.setCity()`. It's possible that you may have to set it yourself in certain circumstances. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.lat` and `long`

Number get/sets. The latitude and longitude of the current location. This is relevant with regards to getting times for dates. (Not actually prototype values.)
Default: 0.

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.isLeapYear()`

Returns a Boolean, takes no arguments.

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.setCity(city)`

Functions exactly the same as `Hebcal.prototype.setCity(city)`.

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.setLocation(lat, long)`

Functions exactly the same as `Hebcal.prototype.setLocation(lat, long)`.

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.next()`

Return a `Hebcal.GregYear` for the following year. Takes 0 arguments.

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.prev()`

Return a `Hebcal.GregYear` for the preceding year. Takes 0 arguments.

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.getMonth(month)`

```js
var jan = year.getMonth(1);
var dec = year.getMonth(-1);
var sept = year.getMonth('sept');
var nextJan = year.getMonth(13);
```

Takes a single argument, the month to get. Returns `Hebcal.GregMonth` representing the requested month.

If the month is a positive number, it is a month index.
If the month is a negative number, it is a month index from the end of the year.
If the month is a string, it should be a month name in English.

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.days()`

Functions exactly the same as `Hebcal.prototype.days()`.

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.map(mapFunc[, thisArg])`

Functions exactly the same as `Hebcal.prototype.map(mapFunc, thisArg)`.

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.filter(filterFunc[, thisArg])`

Functions exactly the same as `Hebcal.prototype.filter(filterFunc, thisArg)`.

### `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.addHoliday(event)`

Functions exactly the same as `Hebcal.prototype.addHoliday(event)`.

## `new Hebcal.GregMonth(month, year)`

This constructor contains information on a Gregorian month. It is not intended to be directly constructed, but it is fetched by `Hebcal.GregYear.prototype.getMonth()`, so is useful to the end-user. This property was added in Hebcal JS 2.1.

```js
var month = new Hebcal.Month(3, 2014); // March
var month = new Hebcal.Month('September', 2014); // September
```

`month` can be a month name or number; `year` must be a number. An error is thrown if one of these conditions is not met.

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.month`

A number representing the `month` argument to the constructor. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.year`

A number representing the `year` argument to the constructor. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.days`

An array of days in the month. Each day is an instance of `Hebcal.HDate`. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.length`

Number; the length of the month. Equivalent to the length of the `days` array. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.il`

Boolean get/set. Whether or not the location is in Israel. Is usually set by the parent year. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.lat`, `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.long`

Number get/set. Latitude/Longitude of the location. Is usually set by the parent year. (Not actually prototype values.)

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.__year`

Internal, non-enumerable. A reference to the containing year. Only set if the month was created by a `Hebcal.GregYear()`. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.hebmonths`

Array of Hebrew months in the Gregorian month. Each item of the array is an object with properties `month` and `year`. (Not actually a prototype value.)

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.isLeapYear()`

Returns a Boolean, whether or not the year is a leap year.

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.prev()`

Returns a `Hebcal.GregMonth` representing the previous month.

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.next()`

Returns a `Hebcal.GregMonth` representing the following month.

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.getDay(day)`

Returns a `Hebcal.HDate` at a 1-based index in the month. Negative indices are from the end of the month.

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.getYearObject()`

Returns `this.__year` internal value. If it is "unaffiliated" (no `__year`), return a new `Hebcal.GregYear` object.

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.getName()`

Returns a string with the name of the month in English.

### `Hebcal.GregMonth.prototype.map(mapFunc[, thisArg])`

A shortcut for `month.days.map(mapFunc, [thisArg])`.
